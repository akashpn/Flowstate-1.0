# Flowstate — Context-Aware Browsing Interface

Flowstate is a context-aware browsing assistant designed to reduce friction during web navigation by leveraging **semantic memory**, **intent-aware recall**, and **natural voice/text interaction**.

It helps users stay focused by remembering context across browsing sessions and surfacing relevant information precisely when it matters.

## 🚀 Features

- **Voice and text-based navigation** across active web sessions  
- **Vector-based semantic memory** for storing and retrieving contextual interactions  
- **Sub-300 ms contextual retrieval latency** through optimized embedding and indexing pipelines  
- **Intent-aware contextual recall** reducing manual navigation effort by **≈60%**

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React  
- **Backend:** Node.js  
- **AI / Intelligence:** Gemini API  
- **Vector Database:** Milvus  

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)  
- npm or yarn  
- Milvus instance (local or remote)  
- Gemini API key  

### Installation & Running Locally

# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/akashpn/Flowstate-1.0.git](https://github.com/akashpn/Flowstate-1.0.git)

# Enter project directory
cd Flowstate-1.0

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

## 🧪 What This Project Demonstrates

- Building a **user-facing web application** with clear product impact using **Next.js and Node.js**
- Applying **vector-based semantic search (Milvus)** to real-world browsing and session context
- Designing a **responsive, low-latency UX** by optimizing embedding generation and retrieval paths
- Integrating **LLM capabilities (Gemini API)** into a practical interface rather than a demo-style chatbot

---

## 📈 Impact

- **<300 ms** semantic context retrieval using optimized Milvus indexing  
- **60% reduction** in manual navigation by reusing session-level context  
- Persistent understanding of user intent across active browsing sessions  

---

## 📁 Project Structure (High Level)

- **/frontend** → Next.js UI for session handling, user interactions, and rendering context-aware suggestions  
- **/backend** → Node.js APIs for managing context, handling queries, and serving embedding data  
- **/embeddings** → Modules for embedding generation, vector storage, and Milvus-based semantic search

## 🔮 Flowstate 2.0 — Next Evolution

Flowstate 2.0 focuses on expanding from **session-level context** to **long-term, personalized browsing memory**, while maintaining low latency and usability.

The goal is to move from **reactive recall** to **proactive, intent-aware assistance**.

---

## ✨ Planned Enhancements (2.0)

- **Cross-session and cross-device semantic memory** backed by scalable vector storage  
- **Personalized relevance ranking** based on historical interaction patterns  
- **Multi-modal context ingestion**, including documents, PDFs, and notes  
- **Proactive context suggestions** generated without explicit user queries  
- Further **latency and scalability optimizations** for larger context stores  

---

## 🧠 Technical Focus (2.0)

- Improved embedding strategies for **long-term semantic memory**
- Scalable **Milvus indexing and retrieval** for higher data volumes
- Cleaner **Node.js service abstractions and APIs**
- UX improvements in **Next.js** for faster, more intuitive contextual exploration
