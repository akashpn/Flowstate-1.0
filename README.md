# Flowstate — Context-Aware Browsing Interface

Flowstate is a context-aware browsing assistant designed to reduce friction during web navigation by leveraging **semantic memory**, **intent-aware recall**, and **natural voice/text interaction**.

It helps users stay focused by remembering context across browsing sessions and surfacing relevant information precisely when it matters.

## 🚀 Features

- **Voice and text-based navigation** across active web sessions  
- **Vector-based semantic memory** for storing and retrieving contextual interactions  
- **Sub-300 ms contextual retrieval latency** through optimized embedding and indexing pipelines  
- **Intent-aware contextual recall** reducing manual navigation effort by **≈60%**

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React  
- **Backend:** Node.js  
- **AI / Intelligence:** Gemini API  
- **Vector Database:** Milvus  

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)  
- npm or yarn  
- Milvus instance (local or remote)
